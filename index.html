<h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

  <p class="blue"> I was born in upstate New York where there is nothing but country land. My family moved down here while I was young to get away from the cold and ive been in Florida ever since.</p>

  <p>I loved working with animals and going on the computer to watch videos or play games. I started working with Publix at sixteen, and working in the retail industry is just something that isnt for me career wise.</p>
