  <p> Hey There! This is a page where you're gonna learn a little bit about my self. I am currently an associate at Publix Super Markets working in Costumer Service, but im looking to change career's. My goal is to become a fully skilled full stack developer in the next 6 months.</p>
  <p> I have a love for animals and own a ball Python, Southern Flying Squirrels, a grey Squirrel, three four legged furr balls, two macaws and a Persian cat. Even though I have to leave them behind at home I also love to travel exploring several islands on our Pacific Ocean over the years. I have even taken road trips visiting several places within our beautiful U.S.A, but I still have many more places to check off the bucket list.</p>
  <p> Six months from now this will be new and improved portfolio with the help of UCF Bootcamp!</p>
